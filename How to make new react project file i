## Step 1: Open Your Terminal
Using File Explorer, navigate to your React_projects folder.

Click the address bar at the top, type cmd, and press Enter.

Your command prompt is now open and already in the correct location.

## Step 2: Create the React Project
In the terminal you just opened, you will now create the project.

Run the following command:

Bash

npm create vite@latest
The command will ask you a few questions. Answer them one by one:

Project name: Give your project a name (e.g., first-app) and press Enter. This will create a new folder with this name inside React_projects.

Select a framework: Use the arrow keys to choose React and press Enter.

Select a variant: Choose JavaScript and press Enter.

A new folder named first-app is now created inside your React_projects folder.

## Step 3: Install and Run the Project
Your final steps are to go into the new folder and start the project.

In the same terminal, navigate into the new directory you just created:

Bash

cd first-app
Now, install all the necessary libraries by running:

Bash

npm install
Finally, start the live development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The terminal will show you a URL like http://localhost:5173/. Open this in your web browser to see your brand-new React application running. âœ…
